# Tooling-Sass
## I used https://sass-lang.com/guide as my main resource along with some YouTube tutorials and short clips from Siggi and SmÃ¡ri.
### --> There I followed the order in which they explained SASS.
### Step 1: I started by writing my html and what I wanted to have on my website. 
### Step 2: I made my navbar and used 'nesting' and some 'variables'. More variables were created as I worked on my project. 
### Step 3: I worked on my main and included everything I had learned about Sass (tried to keep it simple as you can see from the website). 
### Step 4: Added a partial file to my project which I used to make the padding around my header1. 
### Step 5: Added mixins and decided to use some elements that had to be changed (wicth, height and color) but had the border the same for every circle. 
### Step 6: Added an extension so my h2 would inherit the same settings as my h1. 
### Step 7: Made some additional setting to make my h2, p and img centered.
